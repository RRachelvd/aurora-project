              Aurora is super awesome. I'm gonna look up some facts about her
              and voice my opinion of her in this section. I believe she is from
              somewhere in Scandinavië. Norway maybe? She also reminds me of
              prinses Elsa from Frozen and I believe she also recorded a
              soundtrach to that movie.

                <p>
                  This is the first song I've heard from Aurora. The first thing
                  that drew me in was the catchiness of the song. I also could
                  relate to the lyrics and I found them very uplifting

                  "I don't like the tension, the misapprehensions aout our
                  nature in love. The glorious teachers are no use for creatures
                  who knows how to play with the gods. You got nerves But they
                  never show unless they hurt. So you blamed it all on my love,
                  the moving heart I got. But I don't need a cure for me."

                <p>
                  I absolutely adore the vocals in this song. It is a joy to
                  sing along even though I can imagine that at times I sound
                  like a wolf myself! This song makes me feel wild and free.

                  "Go row the boat to safer grounds. But don't you know we're
                  stronger now. My heart still beats and my skin still feels. My
                  lungs still breathe, my mind still fears. <br />
                  But we're runnin' out of time. All the echoes in my mind cry.
                  I'm running with the wolves tonight."

            Hi! My name is Rachèl and I'm quite fond of Aurora's music. It gives
            me hope for a better world and as a singer myself I love singing
            along with her songs. That's why I decided to dedicate a website to
            her and highlight some of her best work (in my opinion of course). I
            hope you enjoy!
